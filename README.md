# GEHC PCC 2023 Finals Project - Explainable AI

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for our GEHC PCC 2023 Finals Project on Explainable AI. The project focuses on developing three distinct modules: a model for explaining images, another model for explaining textual data, and a user-friendly chatbot for interactive interactions with our AI models. We have integrated all these componenets to our site.

## Project Ideas

### 1. Layer Wise Relevance Propagation - An Image Explanation Technique
Our first idea revolves around creating a model capable of explaining images. This module aims to enhance understanding by providing human-readable explanations for the decisions made by the AI system when processing images.

### 2. OCR applied to Decision Trees - A Model that explains Textual Data
The second component of our project is dedicated to explaining textual data. This model will generate explanations to make the output of AI algorithms on textual data more interpretable and transparent for users.

### 3. Interactive Chatbot
To facilitate user-friendly interactions, we have implemented a chatbot. This chatbot serves as an interface for users to interact with our AI models seamlessly. Users can ask questions, seek explanations, and receive responses in a user-friendly manner, to the explanations given by the OCR with Random Forest Model.
